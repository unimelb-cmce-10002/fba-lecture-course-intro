## What is Business Analytics?

\begin{center}
\textbf{
\alert{Business analytics} is the use of data and analytical tools \\ to support better decision-making.
}
\end{center}

How? By combining:

1.  Statistical thinking
2.  Technological capability, and
3.  Business insight.

**Core mission**: Help organizations answer the fundamental question that drives business strategy:

\begin{center}
\textbf{
\alert{What should we do next?
}
}
\end{center}

{{< fa question >}} So what are the \textbf{\alertc{Foundations}?}

## What are the Foundations of Business Analytics?

**1. Thinking with data**

-   Understand variation, uncertainty, and patterns
-   Use statistical reasoning to support decisions

**2. Technological capability**

-   Access, clean, and analyze data using modern tools
-   Work with data and code

**3. Interpretation and communication**

-   Draw meaning from results in business context
-   Tell clear, persuasive stories to guide action

\vspace{0.75cm}

> Master these foundations, and you won’t just work with data — you'll craft narratives from numbers, and shape smarter decisions.

-   Posted on Canvas

\textbf{When are \alertc{readings available?}}

-   Lectures: Monday the week of the class
-   Tutorials: Monday the week **before** the class

## Coding, Maths and Stats

This is an **analytics** class (it's even in the course name!)

$\implies$ We will **develop an analytics toolkit**

-   **Mainly** \alert{'code based'}, very occasionally we'll need some maths and stats
-   ... We've tried to minimise "math for the sake of it"

**Coding background and interest** among students **is heterogeneous**

-   \alert{Principle: Leave no-one behind}
    -   Instructors are here to help catch you up and provide further guidance as needed
    -   $\implies$ work with us, even when it is hard
    -   Be willing to learn from each other, form study groups, etc

## Things to Keep in Mind

This course is **new** this semester

-   There **will be bugs** ...
-   ... We'll work through them together

Mix of students at various levels, from various backgrounds

-   Learn from other's unique perspectives

We, the lecturers, (awkwardly) straddle the line between different business disciplines

-   We care about 'mechanisms' and explaining why things happen
-   We care about more than established business "theories"
-   We're not 'data scientists' or computer scientists
-   $\implies$ pragmatism towards analysis that asks and answers interesting questions

## Course Objectives

On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to:

1.  \textbf{Explain frameworks and applications} of business analytics in problem solving and decision-making;
2.  Relate \textbf{ethical principles} to the collection, storage, and use of data by business and government organisations;
3.  \textbf{Demonstrate methods} to locate, prepare, and manage data to acquire, describe, visualise, and analyse data, as well as and \textbf{make predictions} and \textbf{draw inferences} for business decision-making;
4.  \textbf{Communicate the results} of a business analytics project \textbf{to a non-technical audience} of decision-makers and stakeholders; and
5.  \textbf{Critically evaluate} various ways in which data analysis and inferences are made using different types of analytics methods.

# What is Business Analytics?

## What is Business Analytics? (redux)

> "Let the data tell its story." — Gregory Crawford, Chief Economist at Zalando

\vspace{1cm}

-   **The story is** ultimately what business analytics is **trying to uncover**.
    -   We help businesses listen to what the data is saying
    -   And translate that into actions.
    -   Examples: Customer needs, Competitive dynamics, Operational bottlenecks
-   **\alert{Our Aim}**: move beyond educated guesswork toward **informed action**

\begin{center}
\textbf{How did we get here?}
\end{center}

## Evolution of Business Decision Making

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/hippo.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Stage 1: Gut Instinct** (The HIPPO Era)

-   The most senior person in the room often had the final say (**Hi**ghest **P**aid **P**erson's **O**pinion.)
-   Lacks transparency and difficult to learn from both successes and failures

## Evolution of Business Decision Making

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/piss_and_moan.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Stage 2: Simple Data Support**

-   Create basic reports and forecasts
-   \alert{Descriptive Analytics helped explain what had happened}
-   Think monthly sales reports or annual budget reviews.

## Evolution of Business Decision Making

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="25%"}
url <- "figs/data_deluge.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Stage 3: Advanced Analytics**

-   \alert{Predictive models} and machine learning to
    1.  Forecast future outcomes; and
    2.  Identify hidden patterns.
-   Gives \alert{accurate predictions of the future}
-   Doesn't answer strategic/ what if questions well

## Evolution of Business Decision Making

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="35%"}
url <- "figs/hippo_help.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Stage 4: Experimentation and Causal Learning**

-   \alert{Comparing how decisions affect outcomes to learn what works best}
-   "What happens if we do X instead of Y?"
-   Modern business analytics is as much about learning and adapting as it is about measuring and predicting

## The Business Analytics Process

\vspace{0.75cm}

> “Data are widely available; what is scarce is the ability to extract wisdom from them.” — Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google

1.  **Defining the Problem** — What decision needs to be made? What are the options? What does success look like?

2.  **Collecting and Cleaning Data** — Gathering relevant data sources and ensuring they’re accurate, complete, and reliable.

3.  **Analyzing Data Appropriately** — Identify patterns, test hypotheses, and quantify trade-offs.

4.  **Communicating Insights** — Tell persuasive, relatable stories with data that clarify the decision at hand and guide action.

5.  **Acting to Create Value** — The goal is not analysis for its own sake, but to generate insights that drive strategy, improve operations, or better serve customers.

## Three Types of Business Analytics

**Fundamental goal:** to make smarter, more confident choices in an uncertain world.

-   **\alert{Different business problems require}** different types of insight—and therefore, **\alert{different analytical tools}**.

Broadly categorized into 3 types of business analytics

1.  Descriptive analytics
2.  Predictive Analytics
3.  Causal Analytics

Let's discuss each in turn...

## Descriptive Analytics

**\alert{Descriptive Analytics}**: **Summarizing** and reporting **what has already occurred** in a business.

**Examples**:

-   What were our total sales last quarter?
-   Which products had the highest return rates?
-   What were the top 10 ASX-listed companies by shareholder return in 2024?

**Tools**:

-   Summary statistics, tables, visualizations, and dashboards.

**Role**:

-   Organize past data in a way that helps managers understand performance, spot trends, or identify anomalies.

## Predictive Analytics

**\alert{Predictive analytics}**: Uses past data to **forecast future outcomes**.

**Examples**:

-   How many customers are likely to churn next month?
-   How are annual depreciation expenses likely to change over the next three years?
-   Will the RBA cut interest rates next month, and if so by how many basis points?

**Tools**:

-   Techniques that identify patterns and extrapolate them forward.

**Role**:

-   Give decision-makers a probabilistic view of likely outcomes.

## Causal Analytics

**\alert{Causal Analytics}**: What would **happen** if we **did X instead of Y**?

**Examples**:

-   What impact will a 10% price increase have on demand?
-   How will a merger affect the takeover firm's share price?
-   Would switching to a new supplier improve delivery times?

**Tools**:

-   Cleverly crafted comparisons to figure out what actually causes what.

**Role**:

-   The decision engine of analytics: it helps businesses not just anticipate the future, but change it deliberately.

## Summary

| Type | Core Question | Typical Tools | Business Use |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Descriptive | What happened? | Summaries, visualizations | Reporting and monitoring |
| Predictive | What might happen? | Forecasting, classification | Anticipating future trends |
| Causal (Prescriptive) | What will happen if we act? | Experiments, causal inference | Strategy and decision-making |

## Exercise

For each question below, identify whether it requires **Descriptive**, **Predictive**, or **Causal** analytics:

1.  "Which marketing channels generated the most leads last month?"
    -   Type: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2.  "How will our share price change if we replace our CEO with our current COO?"
    -   Type: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3.  "Which customers are most likely to upgrade to our premium service?"
    -   Type: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
4.  "Which of our product lines account for the largest share of corporate overhead expenses?"
    -   Type: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
5.  "Would offering free shipping increase our conversion rate?"
    -   Type: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
6.  "Will analysts issue a buy/hold/sell recommendation for our stock next week?"
    -   Type: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Good Decisions Need Good Data

**Principle:** \alert{Garbage in, garbage out}.

-   **Analytics** doesn't make decisions, it **supports decision-making**.

The **quality** of that support **depends on the inputs we provide.**

-   ... And the care with which we interpret the results.

\alert{Implication}: How **data is collected, stored and managed influences** the **quality of analytics** that follows

-   We'll spend a couple of weeks understanding this space too

## Analytics Doesn't Eliminate Uncertainty

**Principle:** \alert{All models are simplifications.}.

-   Models help us focus on what matters, but they also leave things out.

\alert{Implications}: Even with data ...

**1. Uncertainty remains**. We make decisions under incomplete information or ambiguous results.

**2. Trade-offs persist**. No model can fully resolve business tensions. These are managerial choices, not statistical ones.

-   Examples: short-term gains and long-term investments, or between efficiency and innovation

**3. Judgment is essential**. Good analysts don’t just perform analysis—they think critically, question results, and connect the data to the broader context.

# A Taste of What is to Come

## Lachlan's Inbox ...

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/lachlans_inbox.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## Motivation

\alert{Business question}: Does adding personalized content improve email effectiveness?

**Why study this?** Personalized content $\rightarrow$ noninformative content

-   **Prevailing wisdom** is that noninformative content **should not influence consumer behaviour**
-   Most businesses engage in this practice
-   Email marketers have access to this information

{{< fa rocket >}} How would you go about answering this question?

## One way forward

How we're going to answer this question:

-   Run an **experiment in the field**
-   **Varies personalization** & across contexts

Discussion based on [\alertc{Sahni, Wheeler and Chintagunta (2018)}](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2017.1066)

## Field Experiments in One Slide

**Core idea of experiments**: \alert{Randomization into treatment}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="45%"}
url <- "figs/random_allocation.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

PLUS the **measurement of outcome variable(s)**

-   Which have been (carefully) selected

**Comparison of average behaviour** between treatments **delivers causal effects**

-   Subject to some assumptions

\alertc{ What about the "Field"}? Run in **"real world" environments**, rather than computer labs

## Outcome Variable Selection

\vspace{-5cm}

\begin{center}
\textbf{\alert{What Outcomes Could We Measure?}}
\end{center}

## What Outcomes Could We Measure?

Email Marketers **have access to**:

-   Opens
-   Leads
-   Unsubscribes
-   Number of emails sent

And **can construct ratios** using these...

-   Opens / Sent
-   Leads / Opens

and so on ...

## The Experiments

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "figs/swc_experiments.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Today's Focus**: Experiments 1 and 4.

## Experiment 1: Context

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_1_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

\begin{center}
$\implies$ \textbf{Focus: acquiring new customers}
\end{center}

## Experiment 1: Design

**Control Group**: Typical email, no name added to subject line

Eg: "Learn Financial Modeling from Industry Experts"

**Treatment Group**: Names explicitly added to email's subject line

Eg: "Jack, Learn Financial Modeling from Industry Experts"

## Experiment 1: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_1_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## Mechanisms: Answering the "Why"

\vspace{-4cm}

**Lurking question**: Why did we observe this difference?

-   Academic wisdom suggests we shouldn't have seen differences
-   We **want to know why** a difference occurs
-   The "why" is known as \alert{"the mechanism"}

**\alert{Exercise}**: Write down mechanisms you think could be driving the results.

## Potential Mechanisms In the Email Context

The authors propose 3 mechanisms could be driving their results:

-   \[**A**\] Drawing **a**ttention to the email
-   \[**O**\] Shape **o**pinions of reciever / positive cue
-   \[**E**\] Increased **e**laboration via recipient processing

**Question 1**: Are these **really** the only possible mechanisms?

**Question 2**: What are the **consequences** of not finding the right mechanism?

## Mechanisms Predict Different Outcomes

Different mechanisms $\rightarrow$ different patterns in outcome variables

-   Increased **opens** of personalized emails
    -   Consistent with A, O, E
-   **Unsubscriptions**
    -   Increase under A, decrease under O and E
-   **Leads**
    -   increase under E and O ...
    -   ... more evidence for E if even more leads when a discount mentioned

## Experiment 4: Mechanisms

Identify whether mechanism related to:

-   **"Increasing elaboration"**
    -   Noninformative content increases message processing
-   **"Serving as a positive cue"**
    -   Noninformative content increases the recipients liking of the advertiser.

## Experiment 4: Design

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_design.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Doesn't mention discount size** due to worries of being spam filtered

## Experiment 4: Context

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_email.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## Experiment 4: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_descriptives.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## Experiment 4: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_teststats.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Statistical Tests**:

-   Don't worry about the details per se (today!)
-   We are looking for values in the table \< 0.05 to indicate a significant difference in average behaviour between emails

## Experiment 4: Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/experiment_4_teststats.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

\vspace{-0.5cm}

**Statistical Tests**:

-   **A vs B**: adding name alone has no significant effect
-   **B vs D**: adding name in presence of discount increases leads

$\implies$ name increases engagement $\implies$ via elaboration mechanism

## Is it THAT easy? ... Likely Not

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/marketing_letters_title.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="60%"}
url <- "figs/marketing_letters_abstract.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Paper: [\alertc{Defau \& Zauner (2023)}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11002-023-09701-7)

## Is it THAT easy? ... Likely Not

\begin{center}
Marketers re-'discovered' \textbf{\alert{The Novelty Effect}}
\end{center}

"...But in the last years, this \alertc{marketing trick has become a common practice} in email marketing, and therefore, it might be that the behavior of recipients changed as they got used to it... \alertb{we find no indication} that using the **first name of the recipient** in the subject line **has a positive effect** on opening rates orclick-through rates"

BUT

"... we do find that **using the surname of the recipient has a positive effect on opening rates and click-through rates**; an indication that similar marketing techniques still have potential, but that they need to be more creative and surprising"

# Wrapping Up

## Data Use Raises Ethics Issues

Decision about what data to collect, how to analyze it, and how to act on it involves ethical considerations.

Three core ethical concerns

**1. Avoid bias**: Analysis can reflect—and even amplify—existing biases in the data.

**2. Protect privacy**. Complying with legal requirements (like the GDPR or Australia's Privacy Act), but also going beyond compliance to ask: *Are we using this data in ways that our stakeholders would consider reasonable and respectful?*

**3. Promote fairness.** Decisions driven by analytics can have real consequences. Ethical analytics means being transparent about how decisions are made and striving to ensure that outcomes are just and inclusive.

\begin{center}
\textbf{Ethical considerations are \alertc{not} optional}
\end{center}

## How to Approach this Course

Becoming a business analyst means **developing a wide-ranging skillset** — one that draws on data, code, storytelling, and judgment.

**This course is your first step** into the world of business analytics—and it’s **meant to be challenging, empowering, and fun**.

But there may be moments where it feels overwhelming, hard, too technical or unclear. We aim to tackle those together.

**Analytics is a skill you build through doing** — not memorizing.

$\implies$ Come to class with a **growth mindset**.

-   It's okay to be unsure, to try something that doesn't work, to ask a question that feels basic. That’s how you learn. We've all been there.

What we ask of you:

-   Be curious
-   Be open to feedback
-   Be willing to try, fail, and improve
-   Ask questions—lots of them
-   And support each other as we learn
